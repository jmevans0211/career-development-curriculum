# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 

Agile seems better for those making the software. However, it can be difficult for those investing in the project because it is near impossible to give an accurate estimate of cost.

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?

We were all very much on the same page to make, pretty much, everything production ready before moving on to more functionality. This saved us time in the long run.

3. What role did you take on in the project? 

I took a leadership role in some areas to do with planning and organization while I took on a learning role when it came to functionality.

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?

The more concrete the better.

5. How does retro function in a team project?

We did it a few times at the end of a long day. Made us feel good about the progress we made and we left smiling.

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?

We have yet to have a retro discussing our feedback to one another.

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?

It can be difficult. I'd like to improve just in knowning myself more and my journey learning programming. I am getting used to my process in this field and so maybe that's the first step. This way, I'll have the tools to promote clarity when advocating for myself and the team.
